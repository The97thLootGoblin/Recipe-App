# Recipe-App
This recipe app is unlike the others.

Sometimes, we are limited to the stuff in our fridge. Not everyone has full refrigerators, sometimes it's just three packets of ketchup and cheese. Our recipe app can help with that by searching for recipes filtered by what you have! No more torturous recipes that taunt you and your cupboard.

Not only that but recipe app can help filter recipes according to any diets and allergies, and you can always check the nutrition facts on our website. If you prefer recipes the old-fashioned way (on paper) or if you want to save it for later, we provide the option for you to download the recipe. Or, if you want to modernize your recipes, you can do the opposite and add your own recipes to the website. You can even star and like your favorite recipes that will be saved onto your account as we have a login feature.
